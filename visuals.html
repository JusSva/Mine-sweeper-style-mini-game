        <b>This is a mini game that was devised by Dael Kingsmil (Youtube: Monarchs factory; link: https://www.youtube.com/user/MonarchsFactory)
        in her video, where she talks about how to make hunting a pack of displacer beasts more interesting and fun (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV1-VNRqTtA&t=1559s&ab_channel=MonarchsFactory)
        in DnD 5e. As she says in her video, this mini game is inspired by Mine Sweeper.
        <br>
        <br>
    This mini game is her idea, I take no ownership over it, I only made it interactive.</b>

    <!--Rules of the mini game-->
    <b>Rules of the mini game/ how to run it:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
     1) Determine the size of the grid You would like to use 
     <br>
     2) Determine what path did the creature, that is being hunted, take
     <br>
     3) You choose or let the players choose a starting position.
     <br>
     4) The players roll a stealth check (or the equivalent in Your system) for the entire encounter.
        You can choose if You want the Dificulty Class (DC) to be the passive perception of the creatures they are hunting/are in the area, or do You want to
        roll for the beasts each round.
    <br>
     5) If a player character (PC) is proficient with nature or survival, they can add that modifier to either their
        stealth roll or another players. They can do this after they know what rolls were made. Multiple people can add to the same player's roll.
    <br>
     6) The players can then suggest what skills they want to use to track the creature. They focus their attention in one of the 4 
        directions: N, S, E, W. These cardinal directions include things like SW, NE and so on. In other words, choosing direction N will include
    NE, N and NW
    <br>
     7) Decide on the DC that the players need to pass. If they pass, they will either know that their quarry did not go into one of those 3
    directions, or they will know the exact square the quarry moved through (if they got lucky with their guess)
        <ul>
            Performing the check and moving into the adjecent tile (diagonals are fine too) takes the same amount of time
                (lets say 15 min), but the players don't have to move the moment they conclude their check, they can repeat it in a different direction.
                Performing a check will consume another 15 min of their time.
            </ul>
     8) If a party member fails a skill check, they cannot perform another skill check until everyone else in the party has contributed to a skill check
    <br>
     9) Once the party has moved to a new tile, the beasts take their turn. This includes either making a perception check to see if they notice the party in their 
        teritory, and/or moving to a new square to evade/abush the party</p>
